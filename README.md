Malicious URL Detection-A Deep Learning Approach using CNN

This project is a phishing URL detection system that classifies URLs as safe or phishing using machine learning. I collected a labeled dataset of legitimate and phishing URLs, extracted meaningful lexical features (like URL length, use of HTTPS, suspicious keywords), and trained a Random Forest classifier for prediction. I chose Random Forest because it handles mixed features well, is robust, and gives feature importance for explainability. I learned a lot about feature engineering, model evaluation, and cybersecurity patterns. In the future, Iâ€™d enhance it with WHOIS data and deploy it as a real-time detection tool.
